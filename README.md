# flagship
Python codes to process the `Euclid Flagship` mock and to do weak-lensing analyses.

---

## Introduction
Testing...

```python
from wltools.mapping import bin2d
galmap = bin2d(cat.x_gal, cat.y_gal, npix=128)
```

***

## Plans
The plan is to test the `weak-lensing masses` of clusters in the simulation.

### Step 1
Download the mock catalog.

### Step 2
Measure masses. Easy.
